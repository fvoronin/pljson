pljson
======

PLSQL JSON library

This library is designed to allow you to easily manage JSON in Oracle PL/SQL.
The pljson-library.html document describes the installation procedure and how to use this library.

If you have suggestions for improvements, create an issue and I'll take a look.

Enjoy!
